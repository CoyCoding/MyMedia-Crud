# MyMedia-Crud

This is the start to a CRUD application for my owned movies and video games.

Still rough as I brainstormed and built the database, Stored procedures, and application in the same day. 

Only features Select all movies and Select all movies by an actors/director by first and or last name.

However the Stored procedures are set up for when I implement Insert and updates.

Working more on UI to have everything set up for stored procedures to just connect.
