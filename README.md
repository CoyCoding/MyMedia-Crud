# MyMedia-Crud

This is the start to a CRUD application for movies.

As of 10/04-

It selects all and can search all movies by all movie properties

Has proper form validation on all search properties 

Stored procedures are done, but working on making a clean UI

As of 10/06-

search, edit, and add movies are now all implemented.

validation needs some clean edge case clean up.

-Needs structure clean up.

-Needs new User control for Director / Actor.

-I want to reuse the form for both as it is only first/last name textbox for both.
